Selection Sort is the one of the sorting techniques we use to sort an array in increasing or decreasing order respectively.
Initially we select an element and compare it with other elements present at various indices.
Initialize minimum value to index 0.
Then, Traverse the array to find the minimum element other than the selected one in the array.
While traversing if any element smaller than selected element is found then swap both the values.
Then, increment selected index to point to next element.
Repeat until array is sorted.
